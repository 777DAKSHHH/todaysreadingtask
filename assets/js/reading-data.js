    "explanation": `Question no. 1: Paragraph A

The first lines talk about politics (people power), “In fact, Newman believes the main reason for adopting one sort of transport over another is politics: ‘The more democratic the process, the more public transport is favored.’ .. .”

Then the writer explains how a project became successful due to politics, “ . .. . Some years ago, federal money was granted to build a new road. However, local pressure groups forced a referendum over whether to spend the money on light rail instead. The rail proposal won and the railway worked spectacularly well.”

Here, politics & democratic process indicates to people power.

So, the answer is: ii (A successful exercise in people power)`
  },
  "2": {
    "explanation": `Question no. 2: Paragraph B

The answer can be found in the first and last lines of paragraph B.

At the beginning the writer says in line no. 1, “In the UK, travel times to work had been stable for at least six centuries, .. .. .”

Then, in the last lines the writer says, “ .. . .. However, public infrastructure did not keep pace with urban sprawl, causing massive congestion problems which now make commuting times far higher.”

Here, commuting times far higher = an increase in travelling time.

So, the answer is: vii (Increases in travelling time)`
  },
  "3": {
    "explanation": `Question no. 3: Paragraph C

The answer can be found in lines 1-3 of paragraph C. The author mentions here, “There is a widespread belief that increasing wealth encourages people to live farther out where cars are the only viable transport. The example of European cities refutes that. They are often wealthier than their American counterparts but have not generated the same level of car use.”

Here, refutes = the example directly contradicts the previous statement / Higher incomes need not mean more cars

So, the answer is: iv (Higher incomes need not mean more cars)`
  },
  "4": {
    "explanation": `Question no. 4: Paragraph D

The answer can be found in lines 2-3 of paragraph D. The writer says here, “. .. . which used Melbourne as an example. It found that pushing everyone into the city centre was not the best approach. . .. ..”

Here, pushing everyone into the city centre was not the best approach = Avoiding an overcrowded centre,

So, the answer is: i (Avoiding an overcrowded centre)`
  },
  "5": {
    "explanation": `Question no. 5: Paragraph E

The answer can be found in lines 4-6 of paragraph E. The author says here, “. . .. . The explanation for this seems to be that it is valuable to place people working in related fields together. ‘The new world will largely depend on human creativity, and creativity flourishes where people come together face-to-face.’”

Here, valuable to place people working in related fields together = benefits of working together in cities,

So, the answer is: iii (The benefits of working together in cities)`

The study compared the proportion of wealth poured into transport by thirty-seven cities around the world. . . .. ”

Here, the lines suggest that the study compared public and private systems in 37 countries, not every city in the world.

In paragraph no. 3, take a look at the last lines, “ .. . The explosion in demand for accommodation in the inner suburbs of Melbourne suggests a recent change in many people’s preferences as to where they live.”

Here, demand for accommodation in the inner suburbs = people prefer to live in the inner suburbs,

So, the answer is: FALSE`

  "10": {
    "explanation": `Question no. 10: Cities with high levels of bicycle usage can be efficient even when public transport is only averagely good.

Keywords for the question: cities, high levels of bicycle usage, can be efficient, public transport, only averagely good,

Take a close look at paragraph no. 5 as the author mentions in lines 1-3, “Bicycle use was not included in the study but Newman noted that the two most ‘bicycle friendly’ cities considered – Amsterdam and Copenhagen – were very efficient, even though their public transport systems were ‘reasonable but not special’.”

Here, ‘bicycle friendly’ cities = Cities with high levels of bicycle usage, public transport systems were ‘reasonable but not special’ = public transport is only averagely good,

So, the answer is: TRUE`
  },
  "11": {
    "explanation": `Question no. 11: Perth

Keywords for the question: Perth,

Take a look at paragraph no. 2 where the writer mentions about Perth. Lines 1-3 say, “ . .. .. . Western Australian city of Perth is a good example of a city with minimal public transport. As a result, 17% of its wealth went into transport costs. Some European and Asian cities, on the other hand, spent as little as 5%. .. .”

Here, minimal public transport = limited public transport system, 17% of its wealth went into transport costs = inefficient,

So, the answer is: F (inefficient due to a limited public transport system)`

Keywords for the question: Auckland,

In paragraph no. 7, the writer says in lines 2-3, “ . .. . Newman accepts it would be hard for a city as hilly as Auckland to develop a really good rail network.. .. .”

Here, it would be hard = inappropriate,

So, the answer is: D (hilly and inappropriate for rail transport system)`

Keywords for the question: Portland,

Lines 2-5 in paragraph A says, “. … He considers Portland, Oregon, a perfect example of this. Some years ago, federal money was granted to build a new road. However, local pressure groups forced a referendum over whether to spend the money on light rail instead. The rail proposal won and the railway worked spectacularly well. . .. .”

Here, federal money was granted to build a new road = government wanted to build road,

local pressure groups forced a referendum over whether to spend the money on light rail instead = local people wanted rail road,

rail proposal won = move from road to light rail transport system, worked spectacularly well = profitable,

So, the answer is: C (profitably moved from road to light rail transport system)`

Here, men and women over 65 = people over 65, the major medical complaints in this age group = the most common age-related medical problems, the rate = the proportion,

Keywords for the question: seems, these diseases, affecting people, in life, than, in the past,

For this question’s answer, we have to look at paragraph no. 3. Here, in lines 2-3, the writer says, “ . . .. He says the problems doctors accepted as normal in a 65-year-old in 1982 are often not appearing until people are 70 or 75.”

Here, the problems = these diseases, often not appearing until people are 70 or 75 = often affecting people later in life (70 or 75).

So, the answer is: F (later)`

An increase in some cancers and bronchitis may reflect changing smoking habits and poorer air quality, say the researchers. . .. .”

Here, An increase in some cancers and bronchitis = Increases in some other illnesses, smoking habits = personal habits, poorer air quality = pollution,

In paragraph no. 7, the writer says in lines 4-9, “.. .. . That represents a significant drop in the number of disabled old people in the population. If the trends apparent in the United States 14 years ago had continued, researchers calculate there would be an additional one million disabled elderly people in today’s population. According to Manton, slowing the trend has saved the United States government’s Medicare system more than $200 billion, suggesting that the greying of America’s population may prove less of a financial burden than expected.”

Here, significant drop = considerable reduction, disabled old people = elderly people who are disabled (G), may prove less = may be less, financial burden = cost (A),

He found that rats that exercise on a treadmill have raised levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor coursing through their brains. Cotman believes this hormone, which keeps neurons functioning, may prevent the brains of active humans from deteriorating.”
