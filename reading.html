              <h3>Advantages of public transport</h3>
              <p>A new study conducted for the World Bank by Murdoch University’s Institute for Science and Technology Policy (ISTP) has demonstrated that public transport is more efficient than cars. The study compared the proportion of wealth poured into transport by <span id="q6-ref">thirty-seven cities around the world</span>. This included both the public and private costs of building, maintaining and using a transport system.</p>
              <p><span id="q11-ref">The study found that the Western Australian city of Perth is a good example of a city with minimal public transport. As a result, 17% of its wealth went into transport costs.</span> Some European and Asian cities, on the other hand, spent as little as 5%. Professor Peter Newman, ISTP Director, pointed out that <span id="q7-ref">these more efficient cities were able to put the difference into attracting industry and jobs or creating a better place to live</span>.</p>
              <p>According to Professor Newman, the larger Australian city of Melbourne is a rather unusual city in this sort of comparison. He describes it as two cities: ‘A European city surrounded by a car-dependent one’. Melbourne’s large <span id="q8-ref">tram network</span> has made car use in the inner city much lower, but the outer suburbs have the same car-based structure as most other Australian cities. <span id="q9-ref">The explosion in demand for accommodation in the inner suburbs of Melbourne suggests a recent change in many people’s preferences as to where they live.</span></p>
              <p>Newman says this is a new, broader way of considering public transport issues. In the past, the case for public transport has been made on the basis of environmental and social justice considerations rather than economics. Newman, however, believes the study demonstrates that ‘the auto-dependent city model is inefficient and grossly inadequate in economic as well as environmental terms’.</p>
              <p>Bicycle use was not included in the study but Newman noted that <span id="q10-ref">the two most ‘bicycle friendly’ cities considered – Amsterdam and Copenhagen – were very efficient, even though their public transport systems were ‘reasonable but not special’.</span></p>
              <p>It is common for supporters of road networks to reject the models of cities with good public transport by arguing that such systems would not work in their particular city. One objection is climate. Some people say their city could not make more use of public transport because it is either too hot or too cold. Newman rejects this, pointing out that public transport has been successful in both Toronto and Singapore and, in fact, he has checked the use of cars against climate and found ‘zero correlation’.</p>
              <p>When it comes to other physical features, road lobbies are on stronger ground. For example, <span id="q12-ref">Newman accepts it would be hard for a city as hilly as Auckland to develop a really good rail network.</span> However, he points out that both Hong Kong and Zürich have managed to make a success of their rail systems, heavy and light respectively, though there are few cities in the world as hilly.</p>

              <p><strong>Paragraph A</strong><br>
              <span id="q1-ref">In fact, Newman believes the main reason for adopting one sort of transport over another is politics: ‘The more democratic the process, the more public transport is favoured.’ He considers Portland, Oregon, a perfect example of this. Some years ago, federal money was granted to build a new road. However, local pressure groups forced a referendum over whether to spend the money on light rail instead. The rail proposal won and the railway worked spectacularly well.</span> <span id="q13-ref">In the years that have followed, more and more rail systems have been put in, dramatically changing the nature of the city.</span> Newman notes that Portland has about the same population as Perth and had a similar population density at the time.</p>

              <p><strong>Paragraph B</strong><br>
              <span id="q2-ref">In the UK, travel times to work had been stable for at least six centuries, with people avoiding situations that required them to spend more than half an hour travelling to work. Trains and cars initially allowed people to live at greater distances without taking longer to reach their destination. However, public infrastructure did not keep pace with urban sprawl, causing massive congestion problems which now make commuting times far higher.</span></p>

              <p><strong>Paragraph C</strong><br>
              <span id="q3-ref">There is a widespread belief that increasing wealth encourages people to live farther out where cars are the only viable transport. The example of European cities refutes that. They are often wealthier than their American counterparts but have not generated the same level of car use. In Stockholm, car use has actually fallen in recent years as the city has become larger and wealthier.</span> A new study makes this point even more starkly. Developing cities in Asia, such as Jakarta and Bangkok, make more use of the car than wealthy Asian cities such as Tokyo and Singapore. In cities that developed later, the World Bank and Asian Development Bank discouraged the building of public transport and people have been forced to rely on cars – creating the massive traffic jams that characterize those cities.</p>

              <p><strong>Paragraph D</strong><br>
              <span id="q4-ref">Newman believes one of the best studies on how cities built for cars might be converted to rail use is The Urban Village report, which used Melbourne as an example. It found that pushing everyone into the city centre was not the best approach. Instead, the proposal advocated the creation of urban villages at hundreds of sites, mostly around railway stations.</span></p>

              <p><strong>Paragraph E</strong><br>
              <span id="q5-ref">It was once assumed that improvements in telecommunications would lead to more dispersal in the population as people were no longer forced into cities. However, the ISTP team’s research demonstrates that the population and job density of cities rose or remained constant in the 1980s after decades of decline. The explanation for this seems to be that it is valuable to place people working in related fields together. ‘The new world will largely depend on human creativity, and creativity flourishes where people come together face-to-face.</span></p>

              <h3>GREYING POPULATION STAYS IN THE PINK</h3>
              <p>Elderly people are growing healthier, happier and more independent, say American scientists. The results of a 14-year study to be announced later this month reveal that the diseases associated with old age are afflicting fewer and fewer people and when they do strike, it is much later in life.</p>
              <p>In the last 14 years, the National Long-term Health Care Survey has gathered data on the health and lifestyles of more than 20,000 men and women over 65. Researchers, now analysing the results of data gathered in 1994, say arthritis, high blood pressure and circulation problems -the major medical complaints in this age group – are <span id="q14-ref">troubling a smaller proportion every year</span>. And the data confirms that <span id="q15-ref">the rate at which these diseases are declining continues to accelerate</span>. Other diseases of old age – dementia, stroke, arteriosclerosis and emphysema – are also troubling fewer and fewer people.</p>
              <p>‘It really raises the question of what should be considered normal ageing,’ says Kenneth Manton, a demographer from Duke University in North Carolina. <span id="q16-ref">He says the problems doctors accepted as normal in a 65-year-old in 1982 are often not appearing until people are 70 or 75.</span></p>
              <p>Clearly, certain diseases are beating a retreat in the face of <span id="q17-ref">medical advances</span>. But there may be other contributing factors. <span id="q18-ref">Improvements in childhood nutrition</span> in the first quarter of the twentieth century, for example, gave today’s elderly people a better start in life than their predecessors.</p>
              <p>On the downside, the data also reveals failures in public health that have caused surges in some illnesses. An increase in some cancers and bronchitis may reflect changing smoking habits and <span id="q19-ref">poorer air quality</span>, say the researchers. ‘These may be subtle influences,’ says Manton, ‘but our subjects have been exposed to worse and worse pollution for over 60 years. It’s not surprising we see some effect.’</p>
              <p>One interesting correlation Manton uncovered is that <span id="q20-ref">better-educated people are likely to live longer</span>. For example, 65-year-old women with fewer than eight years of schooling are expected, on average, to live to 82. Those who continued their education live an extra seven years. Although some of this can be attributed to a higher income, Manton believes it is mainly because educated people seek more medical attention.</p>
              <p>The survey also assessed how independent people over 65 were, and again found a striking trend. Almost 80% of those in the 1994 survey could complete everyday activities ranging from eating and dressing unaided to complex tasks such as cooking and managing their finances. That represents a <span id="q21-ref">significant drop in the number of disabled old people in the population</span>. If the trends apparent in the United States 14 years ago had continued, researchers calculate there would be an additional one million disabled elderly people in today’s population. According to Manton, slowing the trend has saved the United States government’s Medicare system more than $200 billion, suggesting that the greying of America’s population may prove <span id="q22-ref">less of a financial burden than expected</span>.</p>
              <p><span id="q23-ref">The increasing self-reliance of many elderly people is probably linked to a massive increase in the use of simple home medical aids.</span> For instance, the use of raised toilet seats has more than doubled since the start of the study, and the use of bath seats has grown by more than 50%. These developments also bring some health benefits, according to a report from the MacArthur Foundation’s research group on successful ageing. The group found that those elderly people who were able to retain a sense of independence were more likely to stay healthy in old age.</p>
              <p><span id="q24-ref">Maintaining a level of daily physical activity may help mental functioning, says Carl Cotman, a neuroscientist at the University of California at Irvine. He found that rats that exercise on a treadmill have raised levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor coursing through their brains. Cotman believes this hormone, which keeps neurons functioning, may prevent the brains of active humans from deteriorating.</span></p>
              <p>As part of the same study, Teresa Seeman, a social epidemiologist at the University of Southern California in Los Angeles, found a connection between self-esteem and stress in people over 70. In laboratory simulations of challenging activities such as driving, <span id="q25-ref">those who felt in control of their lives pumped out lower levels of stress hormones such as cortisol</span>. Chronically high levels of these hormones have been linked to heart disease.</p>
              <p>But independence can have drawbacks. <span id="q26-ref">Seeman found that elderly people who felt emotionally isolated maintained higher levels of stress hormones even when asleep.</span> The research suggests that older people fare best when they feel independent but know they can get help when they need it.</p>
              <p>‘Like much research into ageing, these results support common sense,’ says Seeman. They also show that we may be underestimating the impact of these simple factors. ‘The sort of thing that your grandmother always told you turns out to be right on target,’ she says.</p>

              <h4 class="mb-3">READING PASSAGE 3</h4>
              <h3>Numeration</h3>
              <p>One of the first great intellectual feats of a young child is learning how to talk, closely followed by learning how to count. From earliest childhood we are so bound up with our system of numeration that it is a feat of imagination to consider the problems faced by early humans who had not yet developed this facility. Careful consideration of our system of numeration leads to the conviction that, rather than being a facility that comes naturally to a person, it is one of the great and remarkable achievements of the human race.</p>
              <p>It is impossible to learn the sequence of events that led to our developing the concept of number. <span id="q32-ref">Even the earliest of tribes had a system of numeration that, if not advanced, was sufficient for the tasks that they had to perform. Our ancestors had little use for actual numbers;</span> instead their considerations would have been more of the kind Is this enough? Rather than how many? When they were engaged in food gathering, for example. However, when early humans first began to reflect on the nature of things around them, they discovered that they needed an idea of number simply to keep their thoughts in order. <span id="q27-ref">As they began to settle, grow plants and herd animals, the need for a sophisticated number system became paramount.</span> It will never be known how and when this numeration ability developed, but it is certain that numeration was well developed by the time humans had formed even semi-permanent settlements.</p>
              <p>Evidence of early stages of arithmetic and numeration can be readily found. <span id="q33-ref">The indigenous peoples of Tasmania were only able to count one, two, many;</span> those of South Africa counted one, two, two and one, two twos, two twos and one, and so on. <span id="q34-ref">But in real situations the number and words are often accompanied by gestures to help resolve any confusion.</span> <span id="q28-ref">For example, when using the one, two, many type of system, the word many would mean, Look at my hands and see how many fingers I am showing you.</span> This basic approach is limited in the range of numbers that it can express, but this range will generally suffice when dealing with the simpler aspects of human existence.</p>
              <p><span id="q35-ref">The lack of ability of some cultures to deal with large numbers is not really surprising.</span> European languages, when traced back to their earlier version, are very poor in number words and expressions. The ancient Gothic word for ten, tachund, is used to express the number 100 as tachund tachund. <span id="q36-ref">By the seventh century, the word teon had become interchangeable with the tachund or hund of the Anglo-Saxon language, and so 100 was denoted as hund teontig, or ten times ten.</span> <span id="q37-ref">The average person in the seventh century in Europe was not as familiar with numbers as we are today.</span> <span id="q29-ref">In fact, to qualify as a witness in a court of law a man had to be able to count to nine!</span></p>
              <p><span id="q30-ref">Perhaps the most fundamental step in developing a sense of number is not the ability to count, but rather to see that a number is really an abstract idea instead of a simple attachment to a group of particular objects.</span> It must have been within the grasp of the earliest humans to conceive that four birds are distinct from two birds; however, it is not an elementary step to associate the number 4, as connected with four birds, to the number 4, as connected with four rocks. Associating a number as one of the qualities of a specific object is a great hindrance to the development of a true number sense. When the number 4 can be registered in the mind as a specific word, independent of the object being referenced, the individual is ready to take the first step toward the development of a notational system for numbers and, from there, to arithmetic.</p>
              <p><span id="q31-ref">Traces of the very first stages in the development of numeration can be seen in several living languages today. The numeration system of the Tsimshian language in British Columbia contains seven distinct sets of words for numbers according to the class of the item being counted: for counting flat objects and animals, for round objects and time, for people, <span id="q38-ref">for long objects and trees, for canoes</span>, for measures, and for counting when no particular object is being numerated.</span> <span id="q39-ref">It seems that the last is a later development while the first six groups show the relics of an older system.</span> This diversity of number names can also be found in some widely used languages such as Japanese.</p>
              <p>Intermixed with the development of a number sense is the development of an ability to count. Counting is not directly related to the formation of a number concept because <span id="q40-ref">it is possible to count by matching the items being counted against a group of pebbles, grains of corn, or the counter’s fingers.</span> These aids would have been indispensable to very early people who would have found the process impossible without some form of mechanical aid. Such aids, while different, are still used even by the most educated in today’s society due to their convenience. All counting ultimately involves reference to something other than the things being counted. At first it may have been grains or pebbles but now it is a memorised sequence of words that happen to be the names of the numbers.</p>

              <p>Research carried out by scientists in the United States has shown that the proportion of people over 65 suffering from the most common age-related medical problems is <button class="btn btn-link q-link-toggle p-0" data-id="14">(14)</button> and that the speed of this change is <button class="btn btn-link q-link-toggle p-0" data-id="15">(15)</button>. It also seems that these diseases are affecting people <button class="btn btn-link q-link-toggle p-0" data-id="16">(16)</button> in life than they did in the past. This is largely due to developments in <button class="btn btn-link q-link-toggle p-0" data-id="17">(17)</button> , but other factors such as improved <button class="btn btn-link q-link-toggle p-0" data-id="18">(18)</button> may also be playing a part. Increases in some other illnesses may be due to changes in personal habits and to <button class="btn btn-link q-link-toggle p-0" data-id="19">(19)</button> . The research establishes a link between levels of <button class="btn btn-link q-link-toggle p-0" data-id="20">(20)</button> and life expectancy. It also shows that there has been a considerable reduction in the number of elderly people who are <button class="btn btn-link q-link-toggle p-0" data-id="21">(21)</button> , which means that the <button class="btn btn-link q-link-toggle p-0" data-id="22">(22)</button> involved in supporting this section of the population may be less than previously predicted.</p>

                <h3>Please hold the line</h3>
                <p>Nearly all of us know what it’s like to be put on ‘musical hold’. Call almost any customer service number, and you can expect to hear at least a few bars of boring elevator music before an operator picks up. The question is: do you hang up or do you keep holding? <span id="qot-1-ref">That may depend on your gender and what type of music is playing</span>, according to research reported by University of Cincinnati Associate Professor of Marketing, James Kellaris.</p>
                <p>Kellaris, who has studied the effects of music on consumers for more than 12 years, teamed with Sigma Research Management Group to evaluate the effects of ‘hold music’ for a company that operates a customer service line.</p>
                <p><span id="qot-9-ref">The researchers tested four types of ‘on-hold’ music with 71 of the company’s clients</span>, <span id="qot-10-ref">30 of them women</span>. Light jazz, classical, rock and the company’s current format of adult alternative (a mix of contemporary styles) were all tested. The sample included individual consumers, small business and large business segments. Participants were asked to imagine calling a customer assistance line and being placed on hold. They were then exposed to ‘on-hold’ music via headsets and asked to estimate how long it played. <span id="qot-13-ref">Their reactions and comments were also solicited and quantified by the researchers.</span></p>
                <p><span id="qot-8-ref">Service providers, of course don’t want you to have to wait on hold</span>, but if you do, they want it to be a pleasant experience for you. But Kellaris’ conclusions may hold some distressing news for companies. No matter what music was played, the time spent ‘on hold’ was generally overestimated. The actual wait in the study was 6 minutes, but the average estimate was 7 minutes and 6 seconds.</p>
                <p>He did find some good news for the client who hired him. <span id="qot-2-ref"><span id="qot-12-ref">The kind of music they’re playing now, alternative, is probably their best choice.</span></span> <span id="qot-7-ref">Two things made it a good choice. First, it did not produce significantly more positive or negative reactions in people. Second, males and females were less polarised in their reactions to this type of music.</span></p>
                <p>Kellaris’ other findings, however, make the state of musical hold a little less firm: <span id="qot-6-ref">time spent ‘on hold’ seemed slightly shorter when light jazz was played</span>, but the effect of music format differed for men and women. Among the males, the wait seemed shortest when classical music was played. Among the females, the wait seemed longest when classical music was played. This may be related to differences in attention levels and musical preferences.</p>
                <p>In general, <span id="qot-3-ref">classical music evoked the most positive reactions among males</span>; light jazz evoked the most positive reactions (and shortest waiting time estimates) among females. <span id="qot-4-ref"><span id="qot-5-ref">Rock was the least preferred across both gender groups and produced the longest waiting time estimates.</span></span> ‘The rock music’s driving beat kind of aggravates people calling customer assistance with a problem,’ said Kellaris. ‘The more positive the reaction to the music, the shorter the waiting time seemed to be. So maybe time does tend to fly when you’re having fun, even if you’re on musical hold,’ Kellaris joked.</p>
                <p>But unfortunately for companies operating on-hold lines, men and women have different ideas about what music is ‘fun’. ‘The possible solution,’ Kellaris joked, ‘might be for the recorded message to say: if you’re a male, please press one; if you’re a female, please press two. If you are in a bad mood, please hang up and try later.’</p>

              <h4 class="mb-3">READING PASSAGE 2</h4>
              <h3>Did tea and beer bring about industrialisation?</h3>
              <p><strong>A</strong><br>Alan Macfarlane thinks he could rewrite history. The professor of anthropological science at King’s College, Cambridge has, like other historians, spent decades trying to understand the enigma of the Industrial Revolution. <span id="qot-25-ref">Why did this particular important event – the world-changing birth of industry – happen in Britain? And why did it happen at the end of the 18th century?</span></p>
              <p><strong>B</strong><br>Macfarlane compares the question to a puzzle. He claims that there were about 20 different factors and all of them needed to be present before the revolution could happen. The chief conditions are to be found in history textbooks. <span id="qot-14-ref">For industry to ‘take off’, there needed to be the technology and power to drive factories, large urban populations to provide cheap labour, easy transport to move goods around, an affluent middle-class willing to buy mass-produced objects, a market-driven economy, and a political system that allowed this to happen.</span> While this was the case for England, other nations, such as Japan, Holland and France also met some of these criteria. All these factors must have been necessary but not sufficient to cause the revolution. Holland had everything except coal, while China also had many of these factors. Most historians, however, are convinced that one or two missing factors are needed to solve the puzzle.</p>
              <p><strong>C</strong><br>The missing factors, he proposes, are to be found in every kitchen cupboard. <span id="qot-15-ref">Tea and beer, two of the nation’s favourite drinks, drove the revolution.</span> Tannin, the active ingredient in tea, and hops, used in making beer, both contain antiseptic properties. <span id="qot-22-ref">This, plus the fact that both are made with boiled water</span>, helped prevent epidemics of waterborne diseases, such as dysentery, in densely populated urban areas.</p>
              <p><strong>D</strong><br>Historians had noticed one interesting factor around the mid-18th century that required explanation. Between about 1650 and 1740, the population was static. <span id="qot-16-ref">But then there was a burst in population. The infant mortality rate halved in the space of 20 years</span>, and this happened in both rural areas and cities, and across all classes. Four possible causes have been suggested. There could have been a sudden change in the viruses and bacteria present at that time, but this is unlikely. Was there a revolution in medical science? But this was a century before Lister introduced antiseptic surgery. Was there a change in environmental conditions? There were improvements in agriculture that wiped out malaria, but these were small gains. Sanitation did not become widespread until the 19th century. The only option left was food. But the height and weight statistics show a decline. So the food got worse. Efforts to explain this sudden reduction in child deaths appeared to draw a blank.</p>
              <p><strong>E</strong><br>This population burst seemed to happen at just the right time to provide labour for the Industrial Revolution. But why? When the Industrial Revolution started, it was economically efficient to have people crowded together forming towns and cities. But with crowded living conditions comes disease, particularly from human waste. <span id="qot-17-ref"><span id="qot-21-ref">Some research in the historical records revealed that there was a change in the incidence of waterborne disease at that time, especially dysentery.</span></span> Macfarlane deduced that whatever the British were drinking must have been important in controlling disease. They drank beer and ale. For a long time, the English were protected by the strong antibacterial agent in hops, which were added to make beer last longer. <span id="qot-19-ref">But in the late 17th century a tax was introduced on malt.</span> The poor turned to water and gin, and in the 1720s the mortality rate began to rise again. Then it suddenly dropped again. What was the cause?</p>
              <p><strong>F</strong><br>Macfarlane looked to Japan, which was also developing large cities about the same time, and also had no sanitation. Waterborne diseases in the Japanese population were far fewer than those in Britain. Could it be the prevalence of tea in their culture? That was when Macfarlane thought about the role of tea in Britain. <span id="qot-18-ref">The history of tea in Britain provided an extraordinary coincidence of dates. Tea was relatively expensive until Britain started direct trade with China in the early 18th century. By the 1740s, about the time that infant mortality was falling, the drink was common.</span> <span id="qot-20-ref"><span id="qot-23-ref">Macfarlane guesses that the fact that water had to be boiled, together with the stomach-purifying properties of tea so eloquently described in Buddhist texts, meant that the breast milk provided by mothers was healthier than it had ever been.</span></span> No other European nation drank tea so often as the British, which, by Macfarlane’s logic, pushed the other nations out of the race for the Industrial Revolution.</p>
              <p><strong>G</strong><br>But, if tea is a factor in the puzzle, why didn’t this cause an industrial revolution in Japan? Macfarlane notes that in the 17th century, Japan had large cities, high literacy rates and even a futures market. <span id="qot-24-ref">However, Japan decided against a work-based revolution, by giving up labour-saving devices, even animals, to avoid putting people out of work.</span> Astonishingly, the nation that we now think of as one of the most technologically advanced, entered the 19th century having almost abandoned the wheel. While Britain was undergoing the Industrial Revolution, Macfarlane notes wryly, Japan was undergoing an industrious one.</p>
              <p><strong>H</strong><br>The Cambridge academic considers the mystery solved. He adds that he thinks the UN should encourage aid agencies to take tea to the world’s troublespots, along with rehydration sachets and food rations.</p>

              <h3>Team based learning</h3>
              <p><span id="qot-27-ref">With the globalisation of information technology (IT) and worldwide access to the Internet, people from all areas of learning are finding themselves using some form of information technology in the workplace.</span> The corporate world has seen a boom in the use of IT tools, but conversely, <span id="qot-26-ref"><span id="qot-28-ref">not enough people with IT skills that can enter the workplace and be productive with minimal on-the-job training.</span></span></p>
              <p>A recent issue of the New York Times reports that many companies are looking for smart students who may have a budding interest in IT. Some companies, trying to encourage students to attend interviews, provide good salary packages and challenging work environments. For example, one American IT consulting company <span id="qot-29-ref">offers high salaries, annual bonuses, and immediate stock options</span> to potential recruits. <span id="qot-31-ref">It also brings in 25 to 40 prospective applicants at a time</span> for a two-day visit to the company. <span id="qot-30-ref">This time includes interviews, team exercises and social events.</span> <span id="qot-32-ref">The idea behind the team exercises is that the applicants get to see that they will be working with other smart people doing really interesting things, rather than sitting alone writing code.</span></p>
              <p>In the past 10 years, employers have seen marked benefits from collaborative projects in product development. Apart from the work environment, there is also a similar body of research indicating that small team-based instruction can lead to different kinds of desirable educational results. In order to prepare IT graduates to meet these workplace requirements, colleges and universities are also beginning to include team-based educational models.</p>
              <p>One of the leaders in promoting team-based education is the American Intercontinental University (AIU), which has campuses worldwide. <span id="qot-33-ref">AIU offers programs in IT with a major portion of the curriculum based on team projects.</span> AIU has a large body of international students and students from different educational backgrounds. This team-based learning gives the students a sense of social and technical support within the group, and allows students firsthand experience of both potential successes and of inherent problems encountered when working with others.</p>
              <p>Team-oriented instruction has not been the common mode of delivery in traditional college settings. However, since most college graduates who choose to go into an IT work environment will encounter some form of teamwork at work, it is to their advantage that they are educated using collaborative learning and that they are taught the tools needed to work with different people in achieving common goals or objectives.</p>
              <p>In team-based learning, <span id="qot-34-ref">students spend a large part of their in-class time working in permanent and heterogeneous teams.</span> Most teams are made up of individuals with different socio-cultural backgrounds and varying skill levels. <span id="qot-35-ref">Team activities concentrate on using rather than just learning concepts</span>, whilst <span id="qot-36-ref"><span id="qot-38-ref">student grades are a combination of overall team performance and peer evaluation of individual team members.</span></span></p>
              <p>In a team-based environment, the teacher takes on the role of a facilitator and manager of learning, instead of just providing information to passive students. The facilitator/teacher also guides the team in identifying their goals and establishing standards of team performance. Team exercises then help the students to improve their problem-solving skills by applying theory to simulated real-world situations. Working as a team allows students to adopt new roles and empowers them to control their own learning. Students in teams are taught to use each other as resources and accept the responsibility of managing tasks.</p>
              <p>Team members must also study assigned material individually to ensure their preparation for classes. There are individual assessment tests to measure if students have not only read the assigned material, but also understand the concepts of the module, and can apply them to given problems. <span id="qot-40-ref">Additional team assessment tests present a problem for discussion and require consensus, helping students learn critical communication skills.</span> This also enables them to deal with conflicts between members before they escalate to crises. Team presentations (written or verbal) allow the team to focus and build cohesion, with team members sharing the responsibility for presenting and persuading the audience to accept their viewpoint. Feedback on how the team is functioning with task management, team dynamics and overall work is given by the facilitator. <span id="qot-39-ref">Team exercises that are application-oriented help students experience the practical application of concepts and learn from other students’ perspectives.</span></p>
              <p><span id="qot-37-ref">Team-based classrooms are especially beneficial in colleges with international students.</span> Since this type of learning encourages people to listen and communicate with others, share problems, resolve personal conflicts, and manage their time and resources, it is a great environment for students who are in a new social situation. Since social interaction plays an important role during teamwork, team learning has an added advantage for students who are not comfortable in traditional classroom settings. It allows students from different cultures to understand their differences and use them productively. This type of learning environment also allows students to express themselves freely in a team context, rather than feeling singled out as when answering questions in a traditional classroom.</p>
              <p>This learning model was designed to better prepare students for today’s global workplace. Students are encouraged to explore ideas together, to build communication skills and achieve superior results. It is likely that employers will increasingly seek out students with these skills as we move into the future.</p>
